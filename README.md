CSS Modules Starter Kit
====

Get started with CSS Modules in a less scary way.

The `master` branch has the bare minimum:

- cmify
- browserify

Other branches (coming soon)
----

- `hot-reload`: browserify-hmr
- `postcss`: adding autoprefixer and postcss plugins
- `the-lot`: (babel + react + flow)

Running the code
----

After fetching dependencies with `npm install`, run these commands:

- `npm run build`
- Open `index.html` in a browser (on OSX you can do this by entering `open index.html` in a terminal).

You can also try running `node src/index.js` to see the result of using CSS Modules in node.

Your turn
----

Make some edits to `src/`, then run `npm run build` again and refresh the browser.
