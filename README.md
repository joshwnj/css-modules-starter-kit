CSS Modules Starter Kit
====

Get started with [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

The `postcss` branch builds on the [`hot-reload`](https://github.com/joshwnj/css-modules-starter-kit/tree/hot-reload) branch with additional postcss plugins:

- [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [postcss-color-function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)
- [postcss-nesting](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-nesting)

Running the code
----

After fetching dependencies with `npm install`, run these commands:

- `npm run hot`
- Open `index.html` in a browser (on OSX you can do this by entering `open index.html` in a terminal).

You can also try running `node src/index.js` to see the result of using CSS Modules in node.

Your turn
----

Make some edits to js and css files in `src/` to see how the updates are applied in the browser.
